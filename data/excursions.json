With your experienced guide, hike up to the crater’s edge to witness the steaming vents and feel the raw energy of the earth beneath your feet. The tour continues to Palea Kameni, where you can enjoy a relaxing swim in the warm, mineral-rich waters of the hot springs, known for their therapeutic properties. As you sail back, take in the stunning panorama of whitewashed houses clinging to the cliffs of the caldera — a view that truly captures the spirit of the Aegean. A perfect blend of nature, adventure, and relaxation in one iconic Santorini experience.",
